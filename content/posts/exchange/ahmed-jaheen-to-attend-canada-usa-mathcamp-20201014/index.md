Canada/USA MathCamp is an immersive summer experience for mathematically talented students with ages 13‑18 from all over the world. Rather than training students for contests or providing courses for credit, Mathcamp introduces students to the various branches of advanced mathematics they are otherwise unlikely to discover until well into their college years.​Unfolding over five weeks of classes, field trips, hikes, and activities, MathCamp program brings unforgettable adventures for high school students, introducing them to chosen university life at one of the world's leading universities in the United States or Canada including, [Reed College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed_College), [University of Toronto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Toronto), the [University of Washington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Washington), and [Colorado College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_College). However, due to the Coronavirus pandemic, the program was shifted online.

Being offered full financial support, Ahmed was able to successfully attend the 5-week program, pursuing his aspirations in Mathematics and being the first student at STEM October to attend Canada/USA MathCamp 2020. His enthusiasm and determination drove him to successfully get the experience of such a prestigious program and reflect on it at the classroom settings and beyond.
